# propertyChange
* This project allows you to practice using the new style and innerHTML properties you have learned in this chapter.
1. Create an HTML page with the div elements ```div1``` and ```div2```.  
2. Create an external javascript file and use it for steps 3-5.
3. Write some code so that when the link is clicked, the background color of the div element with the id of div1 changes to #CCCCCC and the content of the same element changes to the following:
    ```<strong>Right now!</strong>Was that quick or what?```
4. Link external javascript in HTML file using script tags.
